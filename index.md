## Introduction

[Mesosphere](mesosphere) consists of everything necessary to build out a self-healing, fault-tolerant and scalable solution on top of
[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/).  The stack includes production-proven systems such as Mesos, [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) and [Chronos](https://github.com/mesos/chronos). Our docs aim to cover all aspects of Mesosphere, from understanding the core technology to instructions on how to deploy Mesosphere to production.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is to take our extensive [Intro To Mesosphere](/intro-course/) course which teaches you everything you need to run Mesosphere's software.  This course consists of 20 exercises with video, quick reference commands, further study, and online live help comments.  The course takes you from nothing to running a four node cluster running Mesos, Marathon, Chronos, all built automatically with Ansible.  Take it at your own pace, and if you have any questions simply ask in the comments and we'll help you.
