title: Exercise 3 â€“ Using Apache Mesos
---

Apache Mesos is the foundation of the Mesosphere technology stack and powers all of the communications and
system management.  Mesos uses a simple architecture to give you
intelligent task distribution across a cluster of machines without worrying about where they are
scheduled.  In this module Mesos is used to run and manage services on a four
node cluster.  To get started you must set up the ``mesos-master`` on ``node1``.

**Prerequisite:**
Edit your /etc/hosts file to set node1 to the IP address 192.168.33.10.

In this exercise:

1. Start the ``mesos-master`` and ``mesos-slave`` processes.
2. Test that the ``mesos-master`` and ``mesos-slave`` processes are working as expected.
3. Execute a sample command from the command line.
4. Observe the command's progress from both the command line and a web GUI.

Quick Reference
---------------

Start the mesos-master and mesos-slave processes:

{{ mesos.code("ex3/start_mesos.sh-session") }}

Access the Mesos user interface with your browser at ``http://192.168.33.10:5050`` and confirm that the IP address shown in the user interface is ``192.168.33.10``.  If not, start over by using ``vagrant destroy``.


Test out mesos by using the ``mesos-execute`` command:

{{ mesos.code("ex3/test_mesos.sh-session") }}

With the ``mesos-execute`` command running,  enter ``ctrl-z`` to suspend the command. You can see how it appears in the web UI and command line:

{{ mesos.code("ex3/suspend_execute.sh-session") }}

Further Study
-------------

* Try running a few other commands using ``mesos-execute``.
* Find out what the commands listed in ``mesos help`` do and try to use a few of them.
