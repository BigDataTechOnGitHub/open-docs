## Introduction

This page is still under construction. If this guide will be particularly useful to you, please email Mesosphere support so we can prioritise it accordingly!

This document will outline all the considerations associated with cluster design:

* How many master nodes are necessary?
* How many slave nodes are necessary?
* What frameworks can be run concurrently?
* Does it matter where the nodes are running?
* What sort of network connection is required between nodes?
* What sort of monitoring is necessary?
