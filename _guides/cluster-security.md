## Introduction

This page is still under construction. If this guide will be particularly useful to you, please email Mesosphere support so we can prioritise it accordingly!

This document will outline all aspects of how to secure a Mesosphere cluster and all related security concerns.

This will eventually cover:

* SSL for:
	* internet communication
	* REST API
	* Web Console
* Framework authentication
* Slave authentication
* Docker authentication
* Kerberos
* Executor roles
* Potential security weaknesses:
	* container sandbox (breaking out of a container)
	* Docker credentials that are base64 encoded
