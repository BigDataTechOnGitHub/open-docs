There are several ways to run a Mesosphere cluster on Amazon Web Services.

***
## Elastic Mesos

Elastic Mesos was an early service provided by Mesosphere to allow automated provisioning of Mesos clusters on Amazon AWS. This service has now been deprecated while we work on our next generation provisioning tools.

***
## CloudFormation

We maintain several CloudFormation templates (originally developed by [The Factory](https://github.com/thefactory)). These include templates for [Mesos](https://github.com/mesosphere/cloudformation-mesos) and [ZooKeeper](https://github.com/mesosphere/cloudformation-zookeeper).

***
## Do it Yourself

Instructions on installing Mesosphere manually can be found in our [Setting up a Mesosphere Cluster](/getting-started/datacenter/install) guide.

### Terms and Privacy

Use of Elastic Mesos requires that you accept the [terms and conditions](../../terms) and understand our policy on [privacy](../../privacy).
