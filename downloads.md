Welcome to the world of Mesosphere! This guide will explain what Mesosphere is, why it exists, the benefits it has to offer and how you can get started with it. If you're already familiar with Mesosphere, the [documentation](/) provides more of a reference for all available features.

## What is Mesosphere?

### Mesosphere the Company

Mesosphere is a significant contributor to the Apache Mesos project and is the primary organization writing open source services for Mesos, such as Marathon and Chronos.  At Mesosphere we believe that the traditional way of managing the datacenter servers is broken.  We help our customers manage their clusters in an agile and automated way.

### Mesosphere the Technology

Fixing the datacenter requires a new way of thinking and the tooling that aligns with that approach.  Apache Mesos is the right solution, but Mesos alone doesn't solve all the automation demands of the modern datacenter.  Mesosphere is a complete software solution designed to provide application fault tolerance, effective resource utilization and scaling elasticity. Mesosphere provides easy consoles to manage the deployment and scale of your applications.

Mesosphere provides:

* Application scheduling and scaling
* Application fault-tolerance and self-healing
* Under load application prioritization of applications
* Application service port unification
* Application service discovery
* Application service end-point elasticity

Mesosphere consists of:

* Apache Mesos
* Apache ZooKeeper
* Mesosphere Marathon
* Chronos
* HAProxy

## What is Apache Mesos?

[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) is a popular open source cluster manager which enables building resource-efficient distributed systems. Mesos provides efficient dynamic resource isolation and sharing across multiple distributed applications (including, for example, Hadoop, Spark and Memcache).

Key benefits of Mesos:

* No Vendor Lock-in
* Production Tested Application Scaling to 10,000+ nodes
* Flexible Configuration
* Open Source

You can think of Mesos as the kernel of a distributed operating system for your datacenter.  Mesos solves the cross-cutting concerns of networking, dynamic partition and elastic scale.  However like any operating system, the kernel requires other system services to be useful to the end user.
