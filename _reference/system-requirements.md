## Introduction

This page is still under construction. If this guide will be particularly useful to you, please email Mesosphere support so we can prioritise it accordingly!

<!-- how much memory footprints of each component, os -->

This page will provide:

* memory footprints of each component of a Mesosphere cluster
* OS requirements
* hardware restrictions

### System Ports

We know that in heavily locked down clusters, common in a cloud IaaS solution, that you may need to white list all the ports necessary for mesosphere to run.  This document will provide all ports typically used for Mesos masters, Mesos slaves, Marathon, and Chronos.

<!-- need to whitelist ports (a common problem) -->


<!-- What sort of datacenter hardware (network, in particular) do I need to support a Mesos cluster? -->
